# Phase 1: Deep Foundations

Understand memory and passing correctly from the start.

## 1️⃣ Memory Layout

Stack – Heap – Global – Static – Code

This is the foundation.
If you don’t understand memory, everything else will just be memorization.

## 2️⃣ Pointers vs References

Differences

When to use each

Common mistakes (nullptr, dangling pointers)

## 3️⃣ Pass by Value vs Reference vs Pointer

Performance

Modifying values

When to use each method

## 4️⃣ const (C++ Treasure)

const variable

const pointer

pointer to const

const reference

This is where you start writing clean and professional code.

# Phase 2: Memory Management

The most critical and important part of C++.

## 5️⃣ Constructors vs Destructors

Object lifecycle

Relation to Heap

Memory cleanup

## 6️⃣ Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy

Copy Constructor

Assignment Operator

Double delete issues

This is where many people make mistakes 😅

## 7️⃣ Undefined Behavior (The most dangerous)

Uninitialized variables

Out-of-bounds access

Use after free

This is what separates Junior from Senior C++ developers.

# Phase 3: Modern C++ (C++11/14/17+)

Solutions for old problems.

## 8️⃣ RAII (The core of Modern C++)

Resource Acquisition Is Initialization

Why it’s better than new/delete

Smart memory management

## 9️⃣ Smart Pointers

unique_ptr

shared_ptr

weak_ptr

When to use each

A safe alternative to raw pointers.

## 🔟 C-Style vs Modern C++

malloc/free vs new/delete

char* vs string

Raw pointers vs Smart pointers

A practical + conceptual comparison.

# Phase 4: Data Structures & Libraries

Real-world usage in projects.

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Vector vs Array vs List

Storage

Performance

Memory

Practical use cases

## 1️⃣2️⃣ STL Basics

Containers

Iterators

Algorithms

Write less code with stronger logic.

# Phase 5: Behind the Scenes (How it really works)
## 1️⃣3️⃣ Compilation Process

Preprocessing

Compilation

Linking

Runtime

Understand what really happens when you hit Run.
